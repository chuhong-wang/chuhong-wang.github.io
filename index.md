Hi! I am Chuhong. I am a research scientist in cheminformatics at Toyota Research Institute of North America [TRINA](https://amrd.toyota.com/division/trina/). 

Prior to working at at TRINA, I did my PhD at Johns Hopkins University in computational materials science. My PhD work evolves around the development 
of an algorithm that actively trains machine learning interatomic potentials on-the-fly based on model uncertainty of the new configurations during molecular dynamics. 

My research interest includes data-driven molecule and materials discovery, atomistic simulation and machine learning.
