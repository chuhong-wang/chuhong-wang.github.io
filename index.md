Hi! I am Chuhong. I am a research scientist in cheminformatics at Toyota Research [TRINA](https://amrd.toyota.com/division/trina/). 

I obtained my PhD at Johns Hopkins University in computational materials science. My PhD work evolves around the algorithm development that actively trains machine learning interatomic potentials on-the-fly based on prediction uncertainty of energy and forces in new configurations generated in molecular dynamics simulation. 

My research interest includes scientific software development, cheminformatics, atomistic simulation and machine learning.
